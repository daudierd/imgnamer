ImgNamer
========
__The python script that searches the web to name your images.__

Description
-----------

We all happen to download images from the web with funky names that do not give
any indication of what the image is about. ImgNamer aims to solve that!

By using reverse image search engines and suggestion algorithms, ImgNamer
renames your images with meaningful names.

Project status
--------------

The current version of the program offers the possibility to rename files,
individually or in batch, using Google Images reverse image search results.

Future improvements
-------------------

Here are some of the improvements that will be included in future versions:
* Add TinEye search engines
* Use a list of preferred websites that usually stock photos & art
